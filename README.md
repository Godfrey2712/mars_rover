# TDD
This was done by using the deafult unittest module in Python.

The initial fail test ran was done by inputting wrong values as opposed to the initial default values.

This was done by running a test to check if the result of the output values from the Robot Position is the same as the pre-set values.

The images of these can be seen in this repo.

Run Test by using this command $py test.py $py -3 test.py

Default values to input to test:
- What is the Grid Size?
Input: 5 5

- What is the Robot initial Position:
Input: 1 1 N

- How do you want your Robot to move?
Input: f f r f l f l f

# OUTPUT
('OUTPUT:', 1, 4, 'W')

If the above values are inputted, this will be the output on the console.

For the test to fail, change this value in the test.py
