# TDD
The initial fail test ran was done by inputting wrong values as opposed to the initial default values.

This was done by running a test to check if the result of the output values from the Robot Position is the same as the pre-set values.

The images of these can be seen in this repo.

Default values to input to test:
-What is the Grid Size?
Input: 5 5

- What is the Robot initial Position:
Input: 1 1 N

- How do you want your Robot to move?
Input: f f r f l f l f
